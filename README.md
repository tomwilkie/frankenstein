*NB this is a pre-release, pre-alpha service. Availability will not be 100%.
APIs will change. Data will be lost.*

Project Frankenstein is an API compatible [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)
implementation, that natively supports multitenancy and scale-out clustering.

Project Frankenstein is the internal code name for the project inside
[Weaveworks](https://weave.works), where it forms a major part of
[Weave Cloud](https://cloud.weave.works). If you are interested in using our
hosted Prometheus as a service, please contact
[help@weave.works](mailto:help@weave.works).

## Getting started

Go to https://cloud.weave.works and sign up. Follow the steps to create
a new instance.

Once you have created your instance, note down the 'Service Token' listed
underneath 'Probes' in the box on the right of the screen. You will use this
token to authenticate your retrieval agent with Weave Cloud.

The retrieval agent is (mostly) a normal Prometheus instance. To get it, you
can either build it from source in the
[frankenstein branch of Prometheus](https://github.com/tomwilkie/prometheus/tree/frankenstein)
or
[download a Linux amd64 binary](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwqTw528sZRIWlZNS1RFTFVBcmc).

Once you've got the retrieval agent, you will need to provide a standard
[Prometheus config file](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/configuration/)
so it can discover your services and relabel them appropriately, and then run
the following:

    prometheus -config.file=... -storage.remote.generic-url=http://user:<token>@cloud.weave.works/api/prom/push

Where `<token>` is the Service Token you obtained from Weave Cloud.

Once you have started your retrieval agent you can enter Prometheus queries
into Weave Cloud. Go to https://cloud.weave.works and click the graph icon to
the right of the instance selector:

To use the Prometheus Service with Grafana, configure your Grafana instance to
have a datasource with the following parameters:

- Type: Prometheus
- Url: https://cloud.weave.works/api/prom
- Access: Direct
- Http Auth: Basic Auth
- User: `user` (this is ignored, but must be non-empty)
- Password: <Service Token> (the same one your retrieval agent uses)
